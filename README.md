# Pairs-Trading

## Overview

A pairs trade or pair trading is a market-neutral trading strategy that enables traders to profit from various market conditions, including uptrends, downtrends, or sideways movements. This strategy falls under statistical arbitrage and convergence trading strategies.

In this repository, we present a pair trading strategy applied to the Indian market. We identify cointegrated pairs of stocks and construct trading signals based on the spread between them.

## Methodology

### 1. Cointegration Analysis

- Gather historical price data for a selection of securities.
- Calculate the cointegration test statistic (e.g., Augmented Dickey-Fuller test) for all possible pairs of securities.
- Select pairs with a p-value below a predetermined cutoff (e.g., p < 0.05) to consider them as cointegrated pairs.

### 2. Spread Calculation

- Perform a linear regression on the historical prices of the two securities.
- Determine the coefficient for the linear combination to construct the spread.
- Calculate the spread as the difference between the actual prices and the predicted values from the regression.

### 3. Z-Score Normalization

- Calculate the mean and standard deviation of the spread over a specified lookback period.
- Compute the z-score as the difference between the spread and the mean divided by the standard deviation.

### 4. Trading Signal Generation

- Go "Long" the spread when the z-score is below a negative threshold (e.g., z-score < -1.0).
- Go "Short" the spread when the z-score is above a positive threshold (e.g., z-score > 1.0).
- Exit positions when the z-score approaches zero.

### 5. Backtesting

- Apply the trading signals generated by the methodology to historical price data.
- Calculate the returns and performance metrics of the trading strategy, including Sharpe ratio, maximum drawdown, and cumulative returns.
