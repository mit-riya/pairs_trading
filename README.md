# Pairs-Trading

## Overview

A pairs trade or pair trading is a market-neutral trading strategy that enables traders to profit from various market conditions, including uptrends, downtrends, or sideways movements. This strategy falls under statistical arbitrage and convergence trading strategies.

In this repository, we present a pair trading strategy applied to the Indian market. We identify cointegrated pairs of stocks and construct trading signals based on the spread between them.

## Methodology

### 1. Cointegration Analysis
We identify cointegrated pairs of stocks over a specified time interval. Pairs with a p-value less than a certain cutoff are considered.

### 2. Spread Calculation

The spread between the two series is calculated using linear regression to determine the coefficient for the linear combination of the two securities.

### 3. Z-Score Normalization

To normalize the spread, we calculate the z-score, which measures the relationship of a value to the mean of a group of values in terms of standard deviations from the mean.

### 4. Trading Signal Generation

- Go "Long" the spread when the z-score is below a negative threshold (e.g., z-score < -1.0).
- Go "Short" the spread when the z-score is above a positive threshold (e.g., z-score > 1.0).
- Exit positions when the z-score approaches zero.

### 5. Backtesting

- Apply the trading signals generated by the methodology to historical price data.
- Calculate the returns and performance metrics of the trading strategy, including Sharpe ratio, maximum drawdown, and cumulative returns.
